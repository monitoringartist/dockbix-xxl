#A coldStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting

#SDESC
#A linkDown trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in
#an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
#one of its communication links is about to enter the down
#state from some other state (but not from the notPresent
#state).  This other state is indicated by the included value

#SDESC
#A linkUp trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an
#agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
#one of its communication links left the down state and
#transitioned into some other state (but not into the

#An authenticationFailure trap signifies that the SNMPv2
#entity, acting in an agent role, has received a protocol
#message that is not properly authenticated.  While all
#implementations of the SNMPv2 must be capable of generating
#this trap, the snmpEnableAuthenTraps object indicates
#whether this trap will be generated.
